# Machine Learning for Beginners

Welcome to the "Machine Learning for Beginners" repository! This is your pathway to understanding fundamental machine learning concepts and models. Whether you're a complete novice or have some prior knowledge, this repository is designed to help you get started with the exciting world of machine learning.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide a structured learning experience that covers the core principles of machine learning, with a particular focus on the material from Stanford University's CS229 course. We'll also delve into deep learning concepts from CS230.

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginners**: If you're new to machine learning and want to build a solid foundation, you're in the right place. We'll start with the basics and gradually move into more advanced topics.

- **Self-Learners**: If you're a self-learner looking for high-quality resources to guide your machine learning journey, these Jupyter notebooks are here to assist you.

- **Enthusiasts**: If you're passionate about artificial intelligence and want to understand the inner workings of machine learning models, this repository will provide insights.

## What's Inside

1. **CS229 - Machine Learning**: This section covers the core concepts of machine learning. You'll find Jupyter notebooks that explain key algorithms, principles, and practical implementations.

2. **CS230 - Deep Learning**: In this part, we'll explore deep learning in detail, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.

3. **Practical Examples**: We'll provide hands-on coding examples to help you apply what you've learned.
